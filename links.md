  operating system in just like 5 minutes video? YES! Go watch this 5 minutes video and you won't regret it.

* [How Do Operating System Work?](https://youtu.be/GjNp0bBrjmU?si=HAsJXFPHHzRvJb_u) -- Now, after we learn about the definition of an operating system, we also have to learn about
  HOW do they work? What's even greater is that this video is only 3 minutes long! This video will show us the basics of the hard working operating system.
  We will also learn about primary and secondary memory, device management, and how the operating system provides an interface for the user.
